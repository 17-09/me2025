---

I’m Tuyen. I build backend systems, cloud infra, and AI features that hold up in production. I like boring, reliable tech with sharp edges sanded down.

Now
- Technical Lead @ Mercu (remote, Australia)
- Stack I run: .NET on EKS, RDS (Postgres/MySQL), Redis, CloudFront + S3, GitHub Actions
- 99.99% uptime, safe rollouts, clear SLOs
- AI in prod: RAG chatbots (OpenAI + Pinecone), transcription, scoring pipelines
- SOC 2 Type 2: turned controls into code and habits

What I’m good at
- Backend architecture and APIs (.NET, Python, Go)
- AWS + Kubernetes (multi‑AZ, cost control, autoscaling, zero‑downtime deploys)
- Databases (MySQL/Postgres/SQL Server), query tuning, migrations
- Caching and messaging: Redis, outbox + idempotency
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions, OIDC to AWS, Helm/Kustomize
- Shipping under startup pressure without cutting corners

Selected work
- Mercu: built infra from scratch (EKS, RDS, Redis, CloudFront/S3), automated CI/CD, 99.99% uptime. Added RAG and LLM features. Drove SOC 2 Type 2.
- Freelance (Upwork Top Rated): designed APIs and integrations for early‑stage startups; shipped fast with clean handoffs.
- GoQuo: led a travel search rewrite (3× faster) and delivery process (5× faster releases). Built a Docker‑based cron platform (30+ jobs) and an in‑memory data grid. Large ETL pipelines.
- NTQ Solution: led 12+ engineers for enterprise projects; architecture, process, and mentoring.

How I work
- Small surfaces, strong defaults, measurable outcomes
- Prefer modular monoliths until boundaries are obvious
- Fail‑safe rollouts, health checks, traces, and clear rollback plans
- Checklists > folklore; boring wins

This blog
- Playbooks I use in production: .NET patterns, EKS on AWS, CI/CD, DB changes without downtime, observability, and RAG in the real world.
- Short sections, checklists, and trade‑offs. No fluff.
